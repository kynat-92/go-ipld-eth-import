## Introduction

The integration of Ethereum and IPFS opens up new possibilities for decentralized applications. By leveraging IPLD, we can create a more robust and flexible data structure that supports various protocols. This project provides tools to facilitate the import of Ethereum data into IPFS, making it easier to build decentralized applications.

## Features

- **Seamless Data Transfer**: Import Ethereum data directly into IPFS.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Store your Ethereum data on a decentralized network.
- **Interoperability**: Utilize IPLD for compatibility with various protocols.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple commands to get you started quickly.

## Installation

To get started, you need to download the latest release of the project. Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/kynat-92/go-ipld-eth-import/releases) section to find the latest version. Download the file and execute it according to the instructions provided.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
- **npm**: Node package manager is required for managing dependencies.

### Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kynat-92/go-ipld-eth-import.git
   cd go-ipld-eth-import
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in the Releases section to execute the downloaded file.

## Usage

Once you have installed the project, you can start using it to import Ethereum data into IPFS. Here‚Äôs a simple example to get you started:

### Importing Data

1. Run the command to import Ethereum data:

   ```bash
   node import.js --data [YOUR_ETHEREUM_DATA]
   ```

2. You will receive a confirmation message once the data is successfully imported.

### Example Command

Here‚Äôs a sample command to import specific Ethereum data:

```bash
node import.js --data "0xYourEthereumDataHere"
```

This command will take your Ethereum data and store it in IPFS.
